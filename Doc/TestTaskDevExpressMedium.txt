1. Using DevExpress XPO (code first), create XPO classes and tables in the database (MS SQL Server): Order, OrderDetail, Item.
   Relationship an Order to OrderDetail is one to many

   Fields of the Item table:
   ItemName - Product Name

   Fields of the Order table:
   OrderDate - datetime (date the order was created)
   OrderNum - string (order number, for example Z-12345, 123, etc.)
   OrderStatus - int (1 - new, 2 - in processing, 3 - paid, 4 - completed)

   OrderDetail table fields (Order details):
   Order - link to Order
   Item - link to Item
   OrderDetailQuantity - int (quantity)
   OrderDetailPrice - float (price)

   Using the components of DevExpress, create a form (XtraForm) with two grids (DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl). Also use Layout Controls within form. 
   Upper grid - the register of orders (Order), bottom - order details 
   (OrderDetail). For the data source for grids use XPCollection. When navigating the rows of the upper grid, display in the lower grid details that belong only to the current order
   (the line on which we stand in the upper grid). Grids must ensure the creation, editing and deletion of orders and details.

   Implement a validator for the OrderDetailQuantity field of the OrderDetail table: Allow to enter a quantity > 0. You can choose the method for implementing the validator
   at your discretion.


2. Create another XPO class - ItemInStock (Goods in stock). Fill with test data at your discretion. 
   ItemInStock table fields:
   Item - link to Item
   QuantityOnStock - int (quantity on stock)

   Implement a validator for the OrderDetailQuantity field of the OrderDetail table: Allow adding rows to the order with the quantity not exceeding the quantity on stock
   (OrderDetail.OrderDetailQuantity <= ItemInStock.QuantityOnStock). Relationship - by Item.

Pay your attention: For test task you should use DevExpress components and DevExpress XPO.
